# DATA 221 Assignment 3

**Overview**

This assignment focuses on using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to perform statistical 
analysis, data visualization, and machine learning model development


**Question 1**

This program loads crime data to compute statistical measures for violent crime per population.

**Question 2**

This program visualizes the spread and distribution of violent crime data by creating a histogram and a box plot using matplotlib.

**Question 3**

This program splits kidney disease dataset by creating a 70% training set and a 30% testing set.

**Question 4**

This program trains a KNN classifier to predict kidney disease and evaluates its performance using a confusion matrix and standard 
classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

**Question 5**

This program trains multiple KNN models using $k$ values of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 to identify the optimal neighbor count by comparing their
test accuracies in a summary table.
